# ng-insecure

This Angular application is authenticated, but calls an unsecured API, the endpoint to which is visible in the code bundle on initial page load.

> Data in the unsecured API is falsified for demo purposes.

This repo demonstrates why you should _never_ rely solely on front-end authentication to secure sensitive data.
